(research needed) the date needs to be formatted correctly and probably turned into an integer

still need to be able to remove tasks from all tasks

need to be able to 'edit' tasks in both views

need to be able to cancel initial task creation

make priority buttons need to be only clickable once

when priority button is clicked, have an arrow on the side or glowy thing around it that points to 'priority tasks app

when clicking save, it should keep the previous value inside the fields, not just placeholders

when clicking save, if fields are empty it should do nothing

clicking new task from priority task tab resets the app



**
try making a drop down feature for each task, so when you click it, it expands all the fields from title



justification for webpack - media uploads to task



add an 'edit your tasks here' kind of animation when all tasks is first opened

abstract out the querySelectors into their own utiltiy function and call those selectors when needed





webpack is more suited to my goals for this app as i've considered scalability and granular control of image compression etc, as well as the performance implications

change save value to saved 

need field validation

interactive icons to represent buttons

add 'projects' or lists for tasks to be assigned to

should be able to choose a project when creating a task OR after creating it some ui element,

maybe add a checklist thing to tasks(?)


create new project, prrevent empty field submission

make projects able to be deleted on side bar and have that reflects in all tasks project list

add an undo button after a task has been removed - think deletion array that stores newly deleted tasks. doesnt have to be shared state; just on the relative view state



figure out why assigned is triggering other project boxes



UGRENT -- need to synchronise isMinimised array with the sharedIndex array, removing tasks will apply minimised to incorrect tasks when adding new tasks thereafter (this is only noticeble when removing adn then adding tasks)
